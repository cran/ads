Description: Perform first- and second-order multi-scale analyses derived from Ripley K-function (Ripley B. D. (1977) <doi:10.1111/j.2517-6161.1977.tb01615.x>), for univariate,
 multivariate and marked mapped data in rectangular, circular or irregular shaped sampling windows, with tests of 
 statistical significance based on Monte Carlo simulations.
